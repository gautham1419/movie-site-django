# movie-site-django
I created a movie streaming website using Django for backend and MySQL for database, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front end. Key features include user signup, login, and logout, with secure data handling. The site offers light and dark modes and dynamically displays user details on profile hover, enhancing user experience.
